            <h3>28/04/2021</h3><p>Well, today I didn't do many things. The classes at morning were nice. I learned today that Beryllium can also do covalent bonds, what is very cool. I like a lot all the things related to the Periodic Table and its elements (my favorite one is Mendelevium), but all the junk about organic chemistry is very annoying to me. Like, who thought that namming something as 1,2-metil-1,4-propane was a good idea? In which universe is convenient to say names with numbers within them? But anyway, I have to know it so let's continue.</p>I played some overwatch too but I think my hype is already colding down. That's good. So now I can go back to my old games, such as Nuclear Throne and Momodora RutM. Right now I'm <s>writing this</s> making the sprites of a card of my current game project while I plan the rules and the balancing system (a really cool one, by the way). So I hope I can get able to study, play games and create games. For now I think I'll keep things simple and write my game with Lua + LÃ–VE. It will be easier to implement fast ways to add new cards.<p>Oh, and I'm using my drawing tablet to do my sprites in Aseprite. Really awesome. See you tomorrow, my reader.</p>
