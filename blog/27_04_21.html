            <h3>27/04/2021</h3><p align="justify">Today is a good day. Not because of the classes I got almost the entire day (a really sad and slow moment of the day). But because, after 6 days of issues and free hate to all web developers that can't solve their problems without APIs, I finally finished my updates on this website. I published my blog and, to inaugurate it, this post. I'll try to post daily, but yeah, it will be hard.</p><p align="justify">Today is a good day because today I start writing my day here. A storyline of my life. I'm really bad at remembering things (my HDD only holds ~2 years of data (the past 2 years) and some <i>quebradinhos</i> of other years), so to me is almost therapeutic writing down all my thoughts here. Messages from my Oldself to my Futureself. And it helps me to improve my English (it sounds a lot better in portuguese, "e de quebra me ajuda [...]").</p><p align="justify">I got the idea from the movie The Social Network, when Mark starts posting shit on his blog, line by line, div by div (HTML stuff). I'll try to not post shit, but anyway, I'm happy and excited about all these things.</p><p align="justify">See you tomorrow!</p><br>P.S. I'll make the entire div be justified so I won't need to write &lt; p align = "justified" &gt; all the time
