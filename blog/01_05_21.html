            <h3>01/05/2021</h3><p>Today I had a dream.</p><p>Or last night, I don't remember accurately. But I was awesome. One of the bests. I dreamed with the girl I like since 5 years ago.</p><p>I never got anything with her (I'm one of the ones who stays quiet i a corner hopping that she will notice me) but from time to time I have I dream with her. Normaly it's something like a normal day. I mean, a day I would have if I was still with her at school in eighth grade. Sometimes I just talk to her. Sometimes I'm a little confident and I'm able to invite her out. This time she said something like "I would love to hang out with you as my boyfried", as if she was joking but with a second intention. I agreed saying "I accept this invite" or something like that. We were at some kind of place like a museum or a theater. She was with her dad and I was alone. After the talk she stretched out her arm for me to hook her up and walk together. We sayed together the rest of the night. I don't remember much beyond that, but just this little moment was enough to bring all I felt about her.</p><p>I miss her, but currently I'm not able to talk with her in any way. I lost the little contact I had with her. I'm not the kind of person that is easy to live with. She was the only one who I tried beyond my best to be better than I am, only to keep her close. I think she liked me a little too because she was a little hard to deal too. Looking closely we are very similar. But even I tring my best I can't be with her. Only in my dreams.</p><p>I miss her. A lot.</p>
