            <h3>08/05/2021</h3><p>Hey,</p><p>I've been a little afk lately but I'm here again. I've been a little busy too, thats why I had not writing much the last 5 days. But anyway, here we are to another weekly-daily post.</p><p>I did a new friend at school. I started the presential classes so I met her at class. She is very smart and really nice. Cute if I may say. I got a lot of cool talks with her, specially while walking back to home (she walks with me until the school corner). I missed that kind of interaction. Pretty cool talk about nothing. Spend time with another person. Does great to the soul.</p>I think we can grow an awesome friendship together. Hope she thinks the same. Well, we'll know only after the next episodes of Mateus' Life. But I have great expectations about that.
